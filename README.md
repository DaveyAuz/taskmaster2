# taskmaster2
<ol>
In today's Android application development lab, I built the initial structure of the TaskMaster app. Here is a summary of what I accomplished:

><li>Setup:

Created a new directory and repository named "taskmaster" to hold the app.
Used Android Studio to set up a new Android app project.
Created a README file in the repository with a description of the app and a daily change log.

</li>

><li> Homepage:

Designed the main page of the app to match the provided wireframe.
Added a heading at the top of the page.
Included an image to mock the "my tasks" view.
Added buttons at the bottom of the page to navigate to the "add tasks" and "all tasks" pages.

</li>

><li> Add a Task:

Implemented the "Add a Task" page, allowing users to input task details, including a title and a body.
Added a "submit" button that displays a "submitted!" label on the page when clicked.

</li>

><li> All Tasks:

Created the "All Tasks" page, which consists of an image and a back button.
The "All Tasks" page does not have any specific functionality.

</li>

><li> Documentation:

Created a directory named "screenshots" in the project's root.
Captured a screenshot of the homepage and used Markdown syntax to render the screenshot in the README.

</li>

><li> Testing:

Prepared for future UI testing using Espresso by writing unit tests for unit-testable parts of the code.

</li>

><li> Submission Instructions:

Worked on a non-master branch and made appropriate commits.
Updated the README with changes made during the lab and added a screenshot of the homepage.
Created a pull request to the master branch with the lab work.
Submitted the pull request link on Canvas along with the time spent on the assignment.
This lab laid the foundation for the TaskMaster Android application, setting up the main pages and user interface elements. Further development and feature implementation will build upon this initial structure.
